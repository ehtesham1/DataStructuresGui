# DataStructuresGui

This  development of a tool designed to provide instructional information of the use of various programming data structures. The basic concept is to produce a piece of software that allows users to visualize the behavior of stacks, queues, lists, sets and trees. The final solution allows users to select a particular data structure, then perform typical operations on that structure using a graphical user interface. As operations are performed, a graphical representation of the values should be shown in a manner consistent with how the data structure works.  For example, if the user selects a Stack type data structure then the application would provide buttons to support Push, Pop, and Peek operations. As the user selects the various operations a graphical representation of the stack shows the values being added and removed.

The solution is developed using the Java programming language and the AWT/Swing libraries for the Graphical User Interface. The underlying storage of data is based on the classes provided by the Java SDK. No other 3rd party libraries outside those available within the standard Java Development Kit (JDK) is used. 

The instructional tool takes the form of a typical desktop GUI type application. 

Following are the five struture are used.

1. Stack
2. Tree
3. Set
4. List
5. Queue
